motivation:
  Building from last week's paper outline, I have used the pandoc-scholar-template to build a working draft for the first equilibrium paper.
  This working draft is by no means finished---but it is reasonably well fleshed out in terms of its planned elements, it has a methods section that is approaching completion, and a jump start on the results section.
future-work:
  In future weeks, I will focus on identifying and working on the primary missing elements or sections of the manuscript.
  These can be tackled one at a time as separate weekly posts, and then incorporated into the developing manuscript.
  Fairly soon, I will also be able to bring greater focused attention to the 'Methods' section as a whole, as I begin revising it once it reaches the completed rough draft stage.
key-points:
  - pandoc-scholar-template was used to create a working draft of the equilibrium algorithm paper 1
  - combining of previous lab posts in the markdown document provided an easy road toward creating a draft paper
  - embedding bold editorial comments directly in the manuscript improve the revising process

## Rapid Development of a Working Draft

The content of this working draft was taken from the lab posts over the last month and a half.
After pasting them into the template, they were iteratively reworked to build a coherent narrative.
The current version of the working draft can be found here:

* [Working draft of 'Urgently seeking equilibrium' Paper I](docs/2020-12-18-MEXQAL-working-draft.html)

A critical added element to the process is inclusion of editorial comments marked with my initials (NOTE ASW), shown in bold.
Additionally, the main topic of each section is given in italicized comments marked 'gist'.
Together, these provide a birds eye view of the document as it develops, enabling rapid revising without laborious rereading of extraneous details on every pass of the document.
That way, each revising pass can focus on a different element of the manuscript, speeding its development.
