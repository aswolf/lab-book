## 1. [Revision (not editing) and the creation of value]()
- A holistic overview of what defines good academic writing (creating value for the community of readers) and how to get there through the revision process.
- Revising your own writing is a critical skill for academic success, but often receives little systematic attention in STEM fields.

## 2. [Seeing how others view your work]()
- Techniques to begin seeing the manuscript through the eyes of your readers.
- Begin with 1 sentence summary of article's main point. Create a reverse outline to begin separating what's on the page from what's in your head.
- Highlight topic sentences and note where paragraphs lack a good topic sentence or should be split into multiple paragraphs.
- Analyze what points are missing and which are overly repetitive. Which are poorly supported by evidence and which require more background. Write clear notes for these observations and save for later.

## 3. [Staying productive and managing your writing/research workflow]()
- Academic writing suffers from being important to your career (publish or perish) but rarely urgent (you can always get an extension).
- There are always more time-sensitive tasks on your to-do list and ample motivation to work on them instead.
- A review of productivity techniques and best-practices that elevate writing to your most important task. Ensure that your time is well spent during regular, pre-planned work-sessions that produce concrete research artifacts that move the project forward.

## 4. [Satisfying the 'generic interested reader']()
- Here we imagine crafting a manuscript for a generic reader who is interested and has a basic knowledge of the subject area, but not specific expertise (think department colleagues or grant review panel).
- A first shot at reworking manuscript outline for logical flow. Cut-up method for dramatic reimagining of article structure. Consider new section structure as well as paragraph order.

## 5. [Identify your target audience]()
- Academic manuscripts create value based on how they add to the conversation in a specific community of readers, significantly shaping the final work.
- We begin by identifying the target audience and the existing state of the state of the conversation.
- Examples are pulled from the literature that best represent the target community and how to best convey research findings from this type of work.

## 6. [Joining the conversation in your community]()
- Tailoring your manuscript to the demands of your specific target audience.
- Your community of readers has greater or lesser familiarity with certain concepts, requiring more or less explanation. They also care strongly about some issues and view others as distractions.
- Refine main flow of manuscript to serve reader demands, make use of appendix or manuscript-archive file to hone main story of manuscript.

## 7. [Ensuring quality building blocks at the paragraph-level]()
- Paragraphs are the primary building block of persuasive writing, each making a clear point that furthers the argument.
- Survey every paragraph (especially those previously identified as problematic) and to ensure that they are structurally sound.
- Select 1 example each of a good and bad paragraph. Focus on understanding why the good example rings true and the bad falters. Rework the bad paragraph to improve.

## 8. [Survey, split, and revise whole manuscript]()
- Create priority list of remaining paragraphs needing considerable attention.
- Focus on one section of the paper at a time, and submit for review as each is brought up to standards

## 9. [Catering to the busy reader]()
- Academics are busy and must process more papers than they could every carefully read.
- Do your readers a favor by ensuring the casual, the interested, and the focused reader all gain something.



## Writing to create value: a holistic overview

### Activity
* Watch and take notes. Notice how this view on academic writing as a method of creating value for your scientific community differs from your previous understanding. Write a persuasive journal entry aimed at convincing your future-self of the merits of the perspective.

## Revision

### Seeing how others view your work
* [Revision not editing](https://patthomson.net/2014/02/24/good-academic-writing-its-about-revision-not-editing/)
* [Reverse Outlines](https://writing.wisc.edu/handbook/process/reverseoutlines/)

#### Activity: Making a reverse outline
* Getting out of your own head is critical to see all the gaps, leaps, or stumbles in your current draft
* Create a reverse outline of your manuscript (1 sentence/paragraph) and save as a separate document. Include section/sub-section structure of document.
* Note cases where 1 sentence seems insufficient
* Include figures with 1 sentence summary in correct location in reverse outline document
* Number every paragraph in original manuscript and in reverse outline (allows us to reorganize while still finding original paragraph).

#### Activity: Analyzing your reverse outline
* Highlight the 'topic sentence' (often the 1st sentence but not always) in each paragraph that best captures the overview sentence.
* Split trouble paragraphs that require 2 topic sentences and update reverse outline.
* Read over reverse outline and analyze for logical order or manuscript. There are countless possibilites for structure and ordering of a manuscript. The rough draft is just one and likely far from optimal. It was created in the trenches (during the drafting process), and now our reverse outline should give a whole new perspective.
* Create new restructured reverse outline document (save as separate doc). Crafting a new document flow is a puzzle requiring a playful/experimental attitude. Create one (or two) alternatives that seem more logical given this 10,000 foot perspective of your manuscript. reorder paragraph topics. Consider major changes to sections and sub-sections. The point here is potentially transformative alteration of your manuscript. If you can't see any changes, walk away and come back later when feeling more relaxed or creative.
* Save new updated reverse outline
